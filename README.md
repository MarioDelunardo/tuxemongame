 Just for learn and fun

 Hello. Welcome to Tuxemon Game project.

 This game was develop to be a Final Project of the Code in Place.
 So it has no commercial purpose or anything like that. Just for learn and fun.
 In future implementation i want to make a graphic environment to make it more
 playable using Pygame.

 Many thanks to all the people who make this Python course possible.

 There is a project already in progress with Tuxemon theme. Make shure to check it out:

 Some notes:

    - To change the speed of the game, just edit the 'TIME' value on settings.py

    - On createtuxemon.py make shure 'DIR' has tha right path of the root game folder
      Otherwise it can't access the .json files and the Game crash
