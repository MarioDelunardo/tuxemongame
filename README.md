 Just for learn and fun

 Hello. Welcome to Tuxemon Game project.

 This game was develop to be a Final Project of Code in Place.
 So it has no commercial purpose or anything like that. Just for learn more about python programming and have fun.
 The next step for future implementation is to make a graphic environment using Pygame.

 Many thanks to all the people who made this Python course possible.

 There is a project already in progress with Tuxemon theme. Make sure to check it out:

 Some notes:

    - To change the speed of the game, just edit the 'TIME' value on settings.py

    - On createtuxemon.py make shure 'DIR' has the full path of the root game folder
      Otherwise it can't access the .json files and the Game crash
